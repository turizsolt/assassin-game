# assassin-game
Implementation of the initial drawing of the classical assassin game. Each people should be randomly inserted into one big circle, but nobody should know where (s)he is exactly.

This software is not recommended when you are playing with more than 10 people, because it's linear process. You can use the software, but keep in mind it will be a slow process.

# About the assasin-game:

The winner is the player who is the last man standing.
For each player a target is assigned. He or she should "assassin" his or her target.
The method can be anything, e.g. tap his/her shoulders, give a hug, give a post it to the target, whisper to the target's ear a strange word, etc...
When this happens, the target is "dead", and eliminated from the game.
The assassin inherits the the target's target - so the circle will narrow and narrow until there are only two player left.
Now they are against each other, but they do not know how many of the still alive.
You win, when you inherit your own name from your target.
